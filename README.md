Login Form (Styled with JavaScript)

This project is a simple login form built with HTML and styled entirely using JavaScript without any external CSS. It demonstrates how inline styles can be applied dynamically through JavaScript. The form includes username and password fields with a styled submit button for a clean and modern look.
